/**
 * The whole web3 provider tree: wagmi, React Query, RainbowKit.
 *
 * Replaces the former SmartWalletProvider/DynamicRoot pair. Dynamic (the Dezen
 * embedded wallet) has been removed, so third-party wallets through RainbowKit
 * are the only way to connect.
 *
 * Note where RainbowKitProvider now sits. It used to live INSIDE DynamicRoot,
 * which was lazy-loaded and mounted only for signed-in users with the feature
 * on - so the external wallet picker quietly depended on Dynamic being present,
 * and turning Dynamic off would have taken RainbowKit down with it. It is
 * mounted unconditionally here, which is what makes the removal safe.
 *
 * There is no longer a lazy boundary or a boot-time session gate: the tree is
 * the same for every visitor, signed in or not, so nothing can remount the app
 * mid-session the way swapping trees used to.
