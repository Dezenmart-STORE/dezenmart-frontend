/**
 * Display metadata (id, name, logo) for the third-party wallets we offer.
 *
 * Why this exists rather than reading it off RainbowKit's <WalletButton>:
 * WalletButton resolves its wallet from wagmi's *live* connector list and
 * throws "Connector not found" when the id isn't there
 * (WalletButtonRenderer.tsx). In "dezen" mode DynamicWagmiConnector replaces
 * that list with the single embedded-wallet connector on every render
 * (`config._internal.connectors.setState([connector])`), so every RainbowKit
 * connector disappears and rendering a WalletButton throws. Dynamic's own
 * ErrorBoundary then swallowed the throw and remounted the subtree, which is
 * what made the connect modal vanish the instant it opened.
 *
 * The wallet factories are pure metadata builders - calling one returns
 * {id, name, iconUrl, createConnector}. Reading the first three registers
 * nothing, so this is safe in both modes and independent of wagmi entirely.
 * Connecting still goes through RainbowKit, but only in "external" mode where
 * the connectors actually exist.
